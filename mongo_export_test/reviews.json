We built Astra to replace several separate bots with one free, all‑in‑one solution for moderation, levels, music and utilities. It’s still a work in progress and not perfect, but we actively maintain it, listen to feedback and try to improve it based on how real servers use it.","guildId":"857622993702486067","guildName":"✘ | Kaminari Café [Anime & Gaming]","tags":["server_owner"],"verified":true,"featured":true,"approved":true,"createdAt":{"$date":"2025-12-09T16:06:00.955Z"},"updatedAt":{"$date":"2025-12-09T16:06:00.955Z"},"__v":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"6939d4e1fc4e809b69126266"},"discordId":"1355091598647754793","username":"xshin.x","avatar":"067b97cc987330d568729242268f2b80","rating":5,"comment":"Astra is genuinely one of the cleanest and most reliable Discord bots I’ve used.
